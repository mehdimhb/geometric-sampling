def generate_index_shares(n: int, membership: np.ndarray, source_indices: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> List[np.ndarray]:
    """
    Prepares a list of `index_share` arrays, where each array corresponds to a cluster or zone
    and contains the original population indices and their corresponding membership shares.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of index_shares to generate.
        membership (np.ndarray): A 2D NumPy array representing the membership of each
                                 population unit to each cluster, as determined by
                                 AuxiliaryBalancedKMeans. The rows correspond to
                                 population unit indices, and columns correspond to cluster labels.
        source_indices (Optional[np.ndarray]): A 1D NumPy array representing the indices of source.

    Returns:
        List[np.ndarray]: A list of NumPy arrays. Each inner array is an `index_share`
                          array for a specific cluster. It has two columns: the first
                          column contains the original indices of the population units
                          belonging to that cluster, and the second column contains
                          their membership share (e.g., 1 for full membership in a
                          hard clustering, or a float for soft clustering).
